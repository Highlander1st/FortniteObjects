# FortniteObjects
3d objects and textures used in Fortnite, saved here for anybody who wants these for thumbnails or other forms of media creation.

Epic Games prohibits use of the objects within UEFN under their IP policy, while Epic rarely punishes the use of assets imported from Fortnite into UEFN, I personally do not condone such use.

If any employee of Epic Games has an issue with this repository, contact me and the repository will be taken down immediatly.

The purpose of this repository is for people to have easy access to these objects and textures, as opposed to downloading an entire build and tediously searching for each asset in datamining programs.
